# **0. High-Level Package Diagram**

## Objective

Create a high-level package diagram that illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern. This diagram will provide a conceptual overview of how the different components of the application are organized and how they interact with each other.

## Description

In this task, you will develop a package diagram that visually represents the structure of the application, focusing on its three main layers:

1. Presentation Layer (Services, API): This layer handles the interaction between the user and the application. It includes all the services and APIs that are exposed to the users.

2. Business Logic Layer (Models): This layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system (e.g., User, Place, Review, Amenity).

3. Persistence Layer: This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval, interacting directly with the database.

Your diagram should clearly show the three layers, the components within each layer, and the communication pathways between them. The facade pattern should be represented as the interface through which the layers interact.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. Understand the Layered Architecture
    - Review the concept of layered architecture and how it is used to organize an application.
    - Understand the responsibilities of each layer in the context of the HBnB application.

2. Research the Facade Pattern
    - Familiarize yourself with the facade design pattern and how it simplifies interactions between layers by providing a unified interface.

3. Identify Key Components
    - Identify the key components that belong to each layer:
        - Presentation Layer: Services, API endpoints.
        - Business Logic Layer: Core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity).
        - Persistence Layer: Database access objects or repositories.

4. Draft the Package Diagram
    - Create a draft of your package diagram, showing the three layers and their components.
    - Indicate the communication pathways between layers via the facade pattern.
    - Ensure that the diagram is clear, logical, and easy to understand.

5. Review and Refine
    - Review your diagram to ensure that it accurately represents the application's architecture.
    - Make any necessary adjustments to improve clarity and completeness.

## Example of a generic package diagram using Mermaid.js:

'''
classDiagram
class PresentationLayer {
    <<Interface>>
    +ServiceAPI
}
class BusinessLogicLayer {
    +ModelClasses
}
class PersistenceLayer {
    +DatabaseAccess
}
PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : Facade Pattern
BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : Database Operations

# **1. Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer**

## Objective

Design a detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer of the HBnB application. This diagram will depict the entities within this layer, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. The primary goal is to provide a clear and detailed visual representation of the core business logic, focusing on the key entities: User, Place, Review, and Amenity.

## Description

In this task, you will create a class diagram that represents the internal structure of the Business Logic layer. This diagram will include entities, their attributes, methods, and relationships such as associations, inheritance, and dependencies.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. Review the Business Logic Requirements
    - Understand the business rules and requirements for each entity in the Business Logic layer.
    - Review how these entities interact with each other and the significance of their relationships.

2. Identify Key Attributes and Methods
    - For each entity, identify the key attributes and methods that define its behavior and state.
    - Ensure that each entity includes a unique identifier (UUID4) and attributes for creation and update dates.

3. Design the Class Diagram
    - Begin by outlining the entities as classes, specifying their attributes and methods.
    - Represent relationships between entities using appropriate UML notation (e.g., associations, generalizations, compositions).
    - Include multiplicity where relevant.

4. Refine and Review
    - Review the diagram to ensure that it accurately represents the business logic and adheres to the project’s requirements.
    - Refine the diagram as needed to improve clarity and completeness.

## Example of a generic class diagram using Mermaid.js:

'''
classDiagram
class ClassName {
    +AttributeType attributeName
    +MethodType methodName()
}
ClassName1 --|> ClassName2 : Inheritance
ClassName3 *-- ClassName : Composition
ClassName4 --> ClassName : Association
'''

# **2. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls**

## Objective

Develop sequence diagrams for at least four different API calls to illustrate the interaction between the layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) and the flow of information within the HBnB application. The sequence diagrams will help visualize how different components of the system interact to fulfill specific use cases, showing the step-by-step process of handling API requests.

## Description

In this task, you will create sequence diagrams that represent the flow of interactions across the different layers of the application for specific API calls. These diagrams will show how the Presentation Layer (Services, API), Business Logic Layer (Models), and Persistence Layer (Database) communicate with each other to handle user requests.

You will create sequence diagrams for the following API calls:

1. User Registration: A user signs up for a new account.
2. Place Creation: A user creates a new place listing.
3. Review Submission: A user submits a review for a place.
4. Fetching a List of Places: A user requests a list of places based on certain criteria.

## Steps to Complete the Task
1. Understand the Use Cases
    - Review the requirements and business logic for each of the selected API calls.
    - Understand the sequence of operations needed to fulfill each API call, from the moment a request is received by the API to the point where a response is returned to the client.

2. Identify Key Components Involved
    - Determine which components of the system (within each layer) are involved in handling each API call.
    - Identify the order of operations, including method calls and data exchanges between components.

3. Design the Sequence Diagrams
    - Begin by drafting the sequence of interactions for each API call.
    - For each diagram, start with the API call from the Presentation Layer, followed by interactions with the Business Logic Layer, and ending with operations in the Persistence Layer.
    - Clearly show the flow of messages, including method invocations, data retrieval, and processing steps.

4. Refine and Review
    - Review your diagrams to ensure they accurately reflect the flow of information and operations required to fulfill each API call.
    - Refine the diagrams for clarity and completeness, ensuring all relevant interactions are captured.

## Example of a generic sequence diagram using Mermaid.js:

'''
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant API
participant BusinessLogic
participant Database

User->>API: API Call (e.g., Register User)
API->>BusinessLogic: Validate and Process Request
BusinessLogic->>Database: Save Data
Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirm Save
BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Response
API-->>User: Return Success/Failure
'''

# **3. Documentation Compilation**

## Objective
Compile all the diagrams and explanatory notes created in the previous tasks into a comprehensive technical document. This document will serve as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB project, guiding the implementation phases and providing a clear reference for the system’s architecture and design.

## Description
In this task, you will bring together the high-level package diagram, detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer, and sequence diagrams for API calls into a single, well-organized document. The goal is to create a cohesive and comprehensive technical document that not only includes the diagrams but also provides explanatory notes that clarify design decisions, describe interactions, and outline the overall architecture of the application.

The final document should be clear, professional, and structured in a way that makes it easy to follow and understand. It will be used as a reference throughout the project, so accuracy and completeness are critical.
